# react-origins: a react skeleton; ready with parcel, babel, bootstrap and redux setup

## How to use:

```
git clone https://github.com/Laziemo/react_origins.git
cd react_origins
sudo npm install -g parcel-bundler
npm install
npm run dev

```

## Details:
This template follows a mobile-first styled Bootstrap-React structure.

This template contains a Nav with three Routes - MainSpace, Services, Works.
Routing is not ideal as browserHistory is not saved. Will be a feature in the update.


This version is falling back to using regular bootstrap rather than react componenet wrappers of bootstrap classes like reactstrap. All reactstrap componenets will be replaced by v1.0.0.
About.js is a basic implementations.

Jumbo.js is a simple Jumbotron with 3 block Buttons. Perfect for landing pages. Stretch them out, embed an HD image, add a p5 sketch?


#basics.css

This css file contains styling for the components.

class::<color>-back and <color>-font/ eg orange-back blue-font ; is where you set your theme colors.

class::outline is used as a reference to stay aware of div boundaries. Use as a wire framing tool.

## Updates:

Improved Routing.
Basic Redux implementaion.
A kitching sink page to display the various elements of reactstrap and the ways in which they can be stylized.

Cool. Have fun!
